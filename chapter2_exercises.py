# 5
# print 5
# x = 5
# print x
# x + 1
# # if you want to x to be 6, x = x + 1
# print x
# x = x + 1
# print x

# 2.3
# Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# delimiter = '.'
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
# width/2
8 # because 12 is not a float, so answer is integer
# width/2.0
7.5 #float
# height/3
36.0
# 1 + 2 * 5
11 #integer
# delimiter * 5
'.....' #string


# 2.4
# user floats
# answer = (4.0/3.0)*3.14*5.0**3.0 = 523.3334
